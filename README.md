# stackprep-mcp

> stackprep as an MCP server — interview & certification prep for any AI client

Works with any MCP-compatible client: **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **Cline**, **Windsurf**, **Continue.dev**, and more.

---

## What it does

stackprep-mcp is an MCP server that turns any AI client into an adaptive technical interview and certification prep coach.

- One question at a time — interview or certification mode
- Instant scoring with doc links after every answer
- Auto-detects wrong answers and builds a named study pack
- Study packs saved to disk — resume tomorrow, sync via iCloud

---

## Install

```bash
uvx stackprep-mcp
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install stackprep-mcp
```

---

## Configure your MCP client

Add to your client's MCP config (e.g. `~/.claude/mcp.json` for Claude Desktop, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stackprep": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["stackprep-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "sk-or-v1-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get a free OpenRouter API key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).

## Study pack storage

Study packs are saved to `~/.stackprep/packs/` by default.

**Sync across devices with iCloud** (recommended on macOS):

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.zprofile
export STACKPREP_PACKS_DIR="$HOME/Documents/stackprep-packs"
```

`~/Documents` is synced to iCloud by default on macOS (requires iCloud Drive > Desktop & Documents enabled). Your packs will be available on any Mac signed into your Apple ID — and readable via the Files app on iPhone.

**Custom path:**

```bash
export STACKPREP_PACKS_DIR="/path/to/your/folder"
```

Point this at any Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive folder for cross-platform sync.

## Session flow

**Certification:**
```
start_session(mode="certification", cert_name="AWS SAA-C03")
→ next_question(session_id)
→ submit_answer(session_id, answer="b")
→ ... repeat ...
→ end_session(session_id)
→ save_study_pack(session_id, name="aws-saa-week1")
```

**Interview:**
```
start_session(mode="interview", cv="...", jd="...")
→ next_question(session_id)
→ submit_answer(session_id, answer="A cache-aside pattern means...")
→ ... repeat ...
→ end_session(session_id)
→ save_study_pack(session_id, name="python-interview-june")
```

**Coming back tomorrow:**
```
list_study_packs()
→ load_study_pack(name="aws-saa-week1")
```

---

## Session persistence

Active sessions are saved to disk automatically. If your MCP client restarts or you switch devices (with iCloud sync enabled), the session is restored when you next call `next_question` or `submit_answer` with the same session ID.

## Also available as a Claude Code plugin

For Claude Projects or direct Claude.ai use, the behaviour rules are also available as a standalone skill file at [plugins/stackprep](https://github.com/youngpada1/stackprep/tree/main/plugins/stackprep) — no install needed.
